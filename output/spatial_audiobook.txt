NATHAN RUBIN DIED because he got brave.
[Sound: Man's voice narrating with somber tone]
Not the sustained kind of thing that wins you a medal in a war, but the split-second kind of blurting outrage that gets you killed on the street.
[Sound: Outraged shouting with street noise in the background]
He left home early, as he always did, six days a week, fifty weeks a year.
[Sound: Footsteps echoing on pavement, early morning ambiance]
A cautious breakfast, appropriate to a short round man aiming to stay in shape through his forties.
[Sound: A short round man quietly eating breakfast]
A long walk down the carpeted corridors of a lakeside house appropriate to a man who earned a thousand dollars on each of those three hundred days he worked.
[Sound: Footsteps echoing down carpeted corridors]
A thumb on the button of the garage-door opener and a twist of the wrist to start the silent engine of his expensive imported sedan.
[Sound: Garage door opens as car engine starts silently]
A CD into the player, a backward sweep into his gravel driveway, a dab on the brake, a snick of the selector, a nudge on the gas, and the last short drive of his life was under way.
[Sound: A CD clicks in as tires crunch on gravel]
Six forty-nine in the morning, Monday.
[Sound: - a clock ticking and birds chirping in the morning]
The only light on his route to work was green, which was the proximate cause of his death.
[Sound: Traffic light changes green as cars accelerate]
It meant that as he pulled into his secluded slot behind his professional building the prelude ahead of Bach’s B Minor Fugue still had thirty-eight seconds left to run.
[Sound: Bach's B Minor Fugue plays softly in the background]
He sat and heard it out until the last organ blast echoed to silence, which meant that as he got out of his car the three men were near enough for him to interpret some kind of intention in their approach.
[Sound: Organ blasting, men approaching with intentional footsteps]
So he glanced at them.
[Sound: A man glancing with subtle movement sounds]
They looked away and altered course, three men in step, like dancers or soldiers.
[Sound: Three men marching in synchronized footsteps]
He turned toward his building.
[Sound: Footsteps on pavement with distant city ambiance]
Started walking.
[Sound: Footsteps crunching on the ground]
But then he stopped.
[Sound: - a man halting footsteps]
And looked back.
[Sound: - footsteps receding]
The three men were at his car.
[Sound: - three men talking near a car]
Trying the doors.
[Sound: - doors opening and closing]
“Hey!” he called.
[Sound: A man shouting loudly]
It was the short universal sound of surprise, anger, challenge.
[Sound: - people gasping, shouting, and challenging]
The sort of instinctive sound an earnest, naive citizen makes when something should not be happening.
[Sound: - an earnest citizen exclaims in surprise]
The sort of instinctive sound which gets an earnest, naive citizen killed.
[Sound: An earnest naive citizen is shouting]
He found himself heading straight back to his car.
[Sound: Footsteps on pavement and car door opening]
He was outnumbered three to one, but he was in the right, which swelled him up and gave him confidence.
[Sound: Man breathing deeply with steady, confident footsteps]
